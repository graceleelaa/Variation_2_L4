			So, we'll go no more a roving 
   			So late into the night, 
			Though the heart be still as loving, 
  			And the moon be still as bright.

			<span id="red-bold">
			For the sword outwears its sheath, 
			And the soul wears out the breast, 
			And the heart must pause to breathe, 
			And love itself have rest.

			<span id="green-bold">
			Though the night was made for loving, 
			And the day returns too soon, 
			Yet we'll go no more a roving 
			By the light of the moon.
